 <h2>7/17/17</h2>
  <p>At the beginning of the day, I was very daunted by Python. I had no prior exposure to it, so it seemed very confusing to me. 
     However, after breaking all my tasks down into simpler steps and relating Python to Scratch, I was slowly able to understand what to do.
     After lots of struggling, I was able to make an interactive program that creates shapes. The program asks the user how many sides he/she 
     wants the shape to have, and using that information, the program displays the correct shape. I found it really challenging to create
     the loop, but it was easier to understand with Hannah's instruction. </p>
 <h2>7/18/17</h2>
  <p>Despite starting off on a really rough note, today was a pretty good day. I enjoyed working with Python and am proud of the
    program we created. My partners and I worked well together, reaching all the goals we set. Our storyline was very enjoyable
    and the program ran smoothly. </p>
 <h2>7/19/17</h2>
  <p>I learned many new things about Python today, and even though everything seemed really diffcult at first, I was able to understand 
    it. Lists are a sequence of data and are really helpful when running an algorithm. Using for loops again helped clarify some of 
    the confusion I had from yesterday. Filtering the picture was really hard at first, but after we broke it down it became easier to 
    comprehend. I am proud of the program we created and would like to explore the filtering process more.</p>
  <h2>7/20/17</h2>
    <p>The trip to Refinery29 was very fun. I enjoyed getting to explore some of the issues they were facing and liked thinking of
      solutions. It was really empowering seeing so many women in charge, and it was inspiring to see the success they have achieved. 
      Their wesbite is really cool and I look forward to exploring it more in the future. Some of the engineers started off in a 
      different field before going into computers, so it was cool to see how you can still change your mind even after establishing
      a career. </p>
  <h2>7/21/17</h2>
    <p>The Python challenges were really fun! I liked the extra level of difficulty they presented and they helped me learn more about 
      Python. It was really challenging getting the betting system to work in Roulette. The money amount after each round would not 
      update, but we were able to resolve this problem by using a global tag before the money variable. The speaker today was also really
      interesting. It's crazy to think that he graduated college without beibng fluent in college, and it's really motivating that
      despite failing multiple times, he has such a happy life. </p>
  <h2>7/25/17</h2>
    <p>Working with the circuit boards was both fun and frustrating. In Physics last year, we worked with ciruit boards to create
      series and parallel circuits, however we did not explore programming at all. The addition of programming made using the ciruit 
      board a lot more interesting, but it added an element of difficulty. When something went wrong, it was hard to pinpoint if the 
      error was in the code or in the wiring. My group and I were able to figure out our issues, however, and we enjoyed working 
      together. </p>
  <h2>7/26/17</h2>
    <p>The robots are really fun to work with and program. We had a lot of difficulty getting the robot to stay still and to 
      go straight. However, using online resources we were able to make the robot do a fully function dance. Initially, we thought 
      we had to link a song from YouTube onto the Piezo, but once our confusion was clarified, we programmed the Piezo to play a 
      song. Our group could have communicated better together, but we got through it. </p>
  <h2>7/27/17</h2>
    <p>Today went much better than yesterday. We were able to figure out to make our robot move in response to the button being clicked.
      Because of some missing screws, we were not able to make the whiskers work, but now we have all the pieces so hopefully 
      tommorow we will be able to program it. The speakers were really cool today. </p>
