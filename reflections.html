 <h2>7/17/17</h2>
  <p>At the beginning of the day, I was very daunted by Python. I had no prior exposure to it, so it seemed very confusing to me. 
     However, after breaking all my tasks down into simpler steps and relating Python to Scratch, I was slowly able to understand what to do.
     After lots of struggling, I was able to make an interactive program that creates shapes. The program asks the user how many sides he/she 
     wants the shape to have, and using that information, the program displays the correct shape. I found it really challenging to create
     the loop, but it was easier to understand with Hannah's instruction. </p>
 <h2>7/18/17</h2>
  <p>Despite starting off on a really rough note, today was a pretty good day. I enjoyed working with Python and am proud of the
    program we created. My partners and I worked well together, reaching all the goals we set. Our storyline was very enjoyable
    and the program ran smoothly. </p>
 <h2>7/19/17</h2>
  <p>I learned many new things about Python today, and even though everything seemed really diffcult at first, I was able to understand 
    it. Lists are a sequence of data and are really helpful when running an algorithm. Using for loops again helped clarify some of 
    the confusion I had from yesterday. Filtering the picture was really hard at first, but after we broke it down it became easier to 
    comprehend. I am proud of the program we created and would like to explore the filtering process more.</p>
  <h2>7/20/17</h2>
    <p>The trip to Refinery29 was very fun. I enjoyed getting to explore some of the issues they were facing and liked thinking of
      solutions. It was really empowering seeing so many women in charge, and it was inspiring to see the success they have achieved. 
      Their wesbite is really cool and I look forward to exploring it more in the future. Some of the engineers started off in a 
      different field before going into computers, so it was cool to see how you can still change your mind even after establishing
      a career. </p>
  <h2>7/21/17</h2>
    <p>The Python challenges were really fun! I liked the extra level of difficulty they presented and they helped me learn more about 
      Python. It was really challenging getting the betting system to work in Roulette. The money amount after each round would not 
      update, but we were able to resolve this problem by using a global tag before the money variable. The speaker today was also really
      interesting. It's crazy to think that he graduated college without beibng fluent in college, and it's really motivating that
      despite failing multiple times, he has such a happy life. </p>
  <h2>7/25/17</h2>
    <p>Working with the circuit boards was both fun and frustrating. In Physics last year, we worked with ciruit boards to create
      series and parallel circuits, however we did not explore programming at all. The addition of programming made using the ciruit 
      board a lot more interesting, but it added an element of difficulty. When something went wrong, it was hard to pinpoint if the 
      error was in the code or in the wiring. My group and I were able to figure out our issues, however, and we enjoyed working 
      together. </p>
  <h2>7/26/17</h2>
    <p>The robots are really fun to work with and program. We had a lot of difficulty getting the robot to stay still and to 
      go straight. However, using online resources we were able to make the robot do a fully function dance. Initially, we thought 
      we had to link a song from YouTube onto the Piezo, but once our confusion was clarified, we programmed the Piezo to play a 
      song. Our group could have communicated better together, but we got through it. </p>
  <h2>7/27/17</h2>
    <p>Today went much better than yesterday. We were able to figure out to make our robot move in response to the button being clicked.
      Because of some missing screws, we were not able to make the whiskers work, but now we have all the pieces so hopefully 
      tommorow we will be able to program it. The speakers were really cool today. </p>
  <h2>8/7/17</h2>
    <p>Cyber security is really interesting. It's a field that I have not explored at all, so it was really cool gaining insight into it. 
      The dictionary attacker was fun, but frustrating. It was difficult because I had no idea what to do. Once I got over the hurdles, 
      however, it was much better. I look forward to the final project. </p>
  <h2>8/9/17</h2>
    <p>The workshop this morning was very really interesting. I love Shark Tank so I really enjoyed hearing about venture capitalists
      and startup companies. I enjoyed working with my final project group and presenting our idea for the first time. I'm super excited
      to start working on the project. We're still determining if an app is a viable option, but hopefully we will be able to create
      an app. The social network we made today was very frustrating, but when it worked, I felt super happy. </p>
  <h2>8/11/17</h2>
    <p>Today's work was not that bad. It originally seemed very daunting, but breaking it down into simple steps made it much 
      more doable. It was really fun organizing the lists and incorporating the code from yesterday in. Python can sometimes be 
      frustrating because of it's syntax errors, but when there are no errors, it's very exciting. I'm so excited to begin working on our 
      final project. My groupmates and I have so many amazing ideas and we have a very solid plan, so I'm looking forward to it 
      coming all together.</p>
  <h2>8/15/17</h2>
    <p>Working on the final project has been a great experience. Sometimes it can be a stress rollercoaster because certain elements 
      refuse to work, but once we figure it out it feels amazing. My group and I work really well together and have made a lot of 
      progress. We have all the duties divided out really well, so we work really efficiently. We struggled a lot today with the 
      navigation bar and header, but in the end we figured it out. Tomorrow we have to work more with the logo, color scheme, and 
      format.</p>
