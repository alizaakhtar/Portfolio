  <h1>Aliza's Reflections</h1>
 <h2>7/17/17</h2>
  <p>At the beginning of the day, I was very daunted by Python. I had no prior exposure to it, so it seemed very confusing to me. 
     However, after breaking all my tasks down into simpler steps and relating Python to Scratch, I was slowly able to understand what to do.
     After lots of struggling, I was able to make an interactive program that creates shapes. The program asks the user how many sides he/she 
     wants the shape to have, and using that information, the program displays the correct shape. I found it really challenging to create
     the loop, but it was easier to understand with Hannah's instruction. </p>
 <h2>7/18/17</h2>
  <p>Despite starting off on a really rough note, today was a pretty good day. I enjoyed working with Python and am proud of the
    program we created. My partners and I worked well together, reaching all the goals we set. Our storyline was very enjoyable
    and the program ran smoothly. </p>
 <h2>7/19/17</h2>
  <p>I learned many new things about Python today, and even though everything seemed really diffcult at first, I was able to understand 
    it. Lists are a sequence of data and are really helpful when running an algorithm. Using for loops again helped clarify some of 
    the confusion I had from yesterday. Filtering the picture was really hard at first, but after we broke it down it became easier to 
    comprehend. I am proud of the program we created and would like to explore the filtering process more.
